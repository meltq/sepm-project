# `conrod` is unmaintained

The crate `conrod` has been [deprecated] since version 0.62.0 released in December 2018. The functionality was split across multiple different crates, with the core functionality being transferred to `conrod_core`. An overview can be found in the [conrod repository].

If you have this crate in your dependency tree, this is very likely by mistake and should be corrected.
