# Misaligned pointer dereference in `ChunkId::new`
The function `ChunkId::new` creates a misaligned pointer by casting mutable pointer of `u8` slice which has alignment 1 to the mutable pointer of `u32` which has alignment 4, and dereference the misaligned pointer leading UB, which should not be allowed in safe function.
