# get-size is unmaintained

get-size's maintainer seems to be unreachable, with no commits and releases pushed for 1 year and no activity on the GitHub repo.

get-size also depends on `get-size-derive 0.1.3`, which uses `attribute-derive ^0.6` a version of the crate which uses the yanked crate `proc-macro-error`.

## Possible Alternative(s)

- [get-size2](https://crates.io/crates/get-size2)
- [typesize](https://crates.io/crates/typesize)
