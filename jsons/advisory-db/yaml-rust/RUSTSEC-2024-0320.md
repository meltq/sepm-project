# yaml-rust is unmaintained.

The maintainer seems [unreachable](https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust/issues/197).

Many issues and pull requests have been submitted over the years
without any [response](https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust/issues/160).

## Alternatives

Consider switching to the actively maintained `yaml-rust2` fork of the original project:

- [yaml-rust2](https://github.com/Ethiraric/yaml-rust2)
- [yaml-rust2 @ crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-rust2)
