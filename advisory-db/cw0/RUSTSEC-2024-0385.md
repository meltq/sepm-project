# `cw0` is unmaintained

The crate `cw0` was first [renamed to `utils`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/pull/508) in 2021 and [then to `cw-utils`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/pull/598) because `utils` was already claimed on crates.io.

The crate `cw0` is not maintained anymore since then and should be replaced with `cw-utils`.
