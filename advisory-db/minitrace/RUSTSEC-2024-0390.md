# minitrace is Unmaintained

The minitrace maintainers have decided to continue the development of minitrace under a new organizational structure to improve community governance.

In the meantime, minitrace will no longer be maintained. For more details, refer to [tikv/minitrace-rust#229](https://github.com/tikv/minitrace-rust/issues/229).

## Possible Alternative(s)

[fastrace](https://github.com/fast/fastrace) is maintained by the same team responsible for minitrace, and users are encouraged to migrate to fastrace.
