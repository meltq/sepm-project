# `rsa-export` is unmaintained

This crate has been deprecated in favour of using the native support for exporting RSA keys into the standard PEM format.  
See [docs.rs documentation].

In addition to that, the operations in this crate (arithmetic and Base64 encoding) are not done in constant-time, 
potentially [exposing the user to sidechannel attacks].
