# `libp2p-tokio-socks5` is unmaintained

Note the repository was archived without an issue so we link directly
to the commit that marked the repository as unmaintained.

To the best of the original authors knowledge the crate has no
vulnerabilities as of the last release, it is just unmaintained due to
laziness - new maintainer welcome.
