# `cosmwasm` is unmaintained

The crate `cosmwasm` is [not used anymore] since spring 2020.
The functionality was split in multiple different crates, such as the standard library `cosmwasm-std` and the virtual machine `cosmwasm-vm`. An overview can be found in the [cosmwasm repository].

If you have this crate in your dependency tree, this is very likely by mistake and should be corrected.
